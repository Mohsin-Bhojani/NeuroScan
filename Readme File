🧠 TumorVision – Brain Tumor Detection AI
An AI-powered system that analyzes MRI scans to detect brain tumors using a custom computer-vision model. Built with a modern, animated UI and optimized for fast performance.
🚀 Features
Real-time tumor detection using a custom-trained Roboflow model
MRI image upload & preview
Bounding boxes + confidence scores
Tumor classification (e.g., Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary)
Personalized treatment recommendation screen
Smooth UI animations with Framer Motion
Fully front-end based — no backend server required
🖥️ Tech Stack
React + TypeScript
TailwindCSS
Framer Motion
Vite
Roboflow Hosted Inference API (YOLOv8)
